## Redis implementation using NodeJS

- The purpose of this project was to implement Redis using NodeJS to do request faster.
- Also, I used some modules to that, like `redis`, `response-time` and `axios`.
- In effect, the time was more quickly. It means, the first request took 567.123ms, the second request took 2.8ms.

**If you want to use this project, just must clone it and then run `npm install`.**

Happy hacking!
